# KhoonCafe Website

progress (im so cooked)
pt1: Project Planning and Design (DONE)
pt2: Implementation of code (halfway done)
pt3: Publication of Website (:skull:)

probably 30% of the way there, still have to deal with databases, login authentication (which so many people have),
some Jave Script (those things don't work :( ), private sites for employees to deal with order count, CSS (pain)

However, although a struggle, at least i'm able to learn more and more as I spiral into the rabbit hole of CS50 Duck 
(no worries, I only use the duck for research of codes and how to implement advance features), still in pain

Files are still in Replit, will transfer them when I feel that the HTML and CSS at least looks good

Total time spent on this project: 17 hours and counting
